    "3) R² cannot capture the effect of individual predictors for making huge contributions to the model, it gives an idea of goodness of fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong Evidence Against the Null Hypothesis (Statistical Significance of Coefficients):\n",
    "1) \"many of the coefficients are larger than 10 while having strong or very strong evidence against the null hypothesis\" refers to statistical significance. This means independent variable (Sp. Def, Generation) will have a real effect on dependent variable (HP). This is indicated by their p-value\n",

    "The Possible Cause of the Contradiction:\n",
    "1) Low R² (17.6%): this shwos that predictors do not capturing all the factors that affect HP in the model. The reason to causing it is: first, some important variables missing in the model. second, the relationship between predictors and outcomes are not strong.\n",
    "2) Significant Coefficients (low p-values and large values): Even though there is a low R², the predictors have a strong impact on independent variables.

There are other factors (variables) influence the HP but not being included in the data.  \n",

    "Statistical Significance of Coefficients reflects the likelihood that the observed associations between predictors and HP are due to chance. Significant coefficients imply there is a non-random relationship between these predictors and HP, even if the model's overall explanatory power is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the predictors in your model show statistically significant associations with HP, but they do not account for much of its variability. This could happen if other factors not included in the model play a larger role in explaining HP.\n",
