    "\n",
    "You provided Python code simulating the Monty Hall problem using the switch strategy. The code randomly assigns the prize to one of three doors, simulates the contestant's choice and the host revealing a goat, and switches the contestant's choice to calculate the probability of winning by switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "I explained the code step by step, covering each part, including the probability theory behind the Monty Hall problem and how switching increases the chances of winning (from 1/3 to 2/3).\n",
    "\n",
    "You then asked for a simplified version of the loop. I provided a more concise version of the loop using list comprehensions to reveal a goat door and switch to the remaining unopened door, reducing unnecessary steps while maintaining the core logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helped clarify the functionality of the Monty Hall simulation and provided a cleaner way to write the code."
